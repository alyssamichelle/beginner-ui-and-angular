# Beginner UI & Angular
[🎥 Live Connect.tech ATL Nov. 2021]

A talk for UI and Angular beginners alike. Let's pull down the Tour of Heroes app (found throughout the Angular docs) and give it a UI upgrade!
 

- Dive into the Tour of Heroes demo application like never before!
- Learn about integrating Sass into your Angular Project.
- Learn how to include a Component Library into your Project. (We will be using Kendo UI but the principles to implement a UI Library are pretty universal.)
- Play around with customizing styles and writing custom CSS from scratch.
- Go over UI/UX principles and implement them on the fly.
- Talk about some accessibility tips along the way.

## UI Challenge

Learning often sticks best when combined with application. Why not take part in a UI Challenge during my talk, to try out some of the new techniques you’ll be learning throughout?!

I have 3 Amazon gift cards up for grabs, all you need to do is clone [this repo](https://github.com/alyssamichelle/angular-tour-of-heroes) and upgrade the UI! Bonus points for including Kendo UI Components. 

How to Enter the UI Challenge
Tweet a screenshot of your upgraded UI with the tag #heykendoui to enter the competition! Swing by the Progress booth or check out Twitter to see if you won! _(I will reply to winning entries on Twitter, letting you know to swing by our booth and pick up your prize after my talk ends.)_

## Getting Started - Tour the Tour of Heroes

- talk about GH vs StackBlitz
    - Clone down the GitHub Repo
    - → https://github.com/alyssamichelle/angular-tour-of-heroes
    - -or- open in StackBlitz and Fork!
    - → https://stackblitz.com/github/alyssamichelle/angular-tour-of-heroes

### Angular Basics

- application structure 
- The CLI
- Routes 
- Modules (covered more later on kendo install)
- Components
- Templates
- Directives: used to modify the behavior, appearance, or structure (ngIf) of the DOM
- Data binding



- Sass variables & CSS Custom Properties
    - syntax differences
    - view encapsulation with :root for css vars
    - If you need to update a variable after view has been rendered, use CSS variables (Sass vars won’t exist anymore)



### Including Sass with a new project
    ng new my-scss-app --style=scss
    
### Including Sass in an existing project:
    ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.style scss

## Including Kendo UI
